Analyze the user's command for a Home Assistant automation. Determine if the user wants the automation to be permanent or temporary (i.e., run only once and then be deleted).

- If the command implies it should run only once (e.g., using words like "once", "just this time", "for now"), respond with the single word: TEMPORARY
- Otherwise, respond with the single word: PERMANENT

Do not add any other text or explanation.

**User Command:**
"{USER_COMMAND}"
