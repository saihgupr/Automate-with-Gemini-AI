# ü§ñ Automate with Gemini AI

Create Home Assistant automations using natural language, powered by Google‚Äôs Gemini AI.
Describe your automation in plain English‚Äîno YAML required. Automations are saved directly to your automations.yaml file and reloaded instantly.

### Example Workflow

Original Command:
```bash
when bedroom temperature goes above 75, notify iphone, only once
```

Converts entity names into entity IDs using Resolve Entities
```bash
when sensor.nodemcu_temperature goes above 75, notify.mobile_app_iphone, only once
```

Automation Added to Home Assistant:
```yaml
- id: '1755258945'
  alias: One-time temperature notification
  trigger:
    - platform: numeric_state
      entity_id: sensor.nodemcu_temperature
      above: '75'
  condition: []
  action:
    - service: notify.mobile_app_iphone
      data:
        message: "Temperature above 75!"
    - service: shell_command.delete_temporary_automation
      data:
        id: '1755258945'
```


## ‚ú® Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Convert plain English to Home Assistant automations
- **Smart Intent Detection**: Automatically detects temporary vs permanent automations
- **Self-Cleaning**: Temporary automations delete themselves after running
- **YAML Validation**: Ensures generated code is syntactically correct
- **Direct Integration**: Automatically adds to your `automations.yaml` and reloads HA
- **Cleanup Tools**: Remove orphaned automations from the UI
- **Command Line Ready**: Use interactively or with command line arguments

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Home Assistant instance
- Free [Google Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
- `curl`, `jq` (for JSON processing)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saihgupr/automate_ai.git
   cd automate_ai
   ```

2. **Set up configuration:**
   ```bash
   cp config.sh.example config.sh
   ```

3. **Edit `config.sh` with your details:**
   ```bash
   GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"
   AUTOMATIONS_YAML="/config/automations.yaml"
   HA_URL="http://your-home-assistant.local:8123"
   HA_TOKEN="your_ha_long_lived_token"
   ```

4. **Make scripts executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x automate_ai.sh
   chmod +x delete_automation.sh
   chmod +x cleanup_orphaned_automations.sh
   ```

5. **Add shell command to Home Assistant** (for temporary automations):
   ```yaml
   shell_command:
     delete_temporary_automation: /share/scripts/automate_ai/delete_automation.sh '{{ id }}'
   ```

## üìñ Usage

### Without Resolve Entities

Enter what you want the automation to do, but make sure to use entity IDs instead of names.

```bash
./automate_ai.sh "Turn on light.living_room_ceiling when binary_sensor.shelf_motion is on"
./automate_ai.sh "Turn off light.bed_lamp at 23:00 if input_boolean.sleep_mode is on"
./automate_ai.sh "Turn the light.bedroom_lights blue and 50% when binary_sensor.bedroom_door is opened after sunset"
```

### With Resolve Entities

For even more natural language automation creation, integrate with [Resolve Entities](https://github.com/saihgupr/resolve_entities) to automatically convert entity names to Home Assistant entity IDs. I made it as a separate script so you can run it wherever it fits best.


```bash
./send_to_automate_ai.sh "Turn on living room ceiling light when shelf motion is on"
./send_to_automate_ai.sh "Turn off the bed lamp at 23:00 if sleep mode is on"
./send_to_automate_ai.sh "Turn the bedroom lights blue and 50% when bedroom door is opened after sunset"
```

### Temporary Automations

Temporary automations are a powerful feature that automatically delete themselves after running once. Perfect for one-time tasks, testing, or situations where you don't want the automation to persist.

#### How Temporary Automations Work

1. **Automatic Detection**: The AI detects when you want a "one-time" or "temporary" automation based on keywords like:
   - "only once"
   - "temporary"
   - "one time"
   - "just this time"

2. **Self-Cleaning**: After the automation triggers and runs, it automatically calls a cleanup service to delete itself from Home Assistant

3. **No Manual Cleanup**: No need to remember to remove the automation later - it handles itself

#### Examples

```bash
./send_to_automate_ai.sh "Only once, turn on living room ceiling light when shelf motion is on"
./send_to_automate_ai.sh "Turn off the bed lamp at 23:00 if sleep mode is on, only once."
./send_to_automate_ai.sh "Just this time, make bedroom lights red when bedroom door is opened"
```

#### Use Cases

- **Testing**: Try out automation ideas without cluttering your automations list
- **One-time alerts**: Get notified about something specific just once
- **Temporary monitoring**: Watch for an event over a limited time period
- **Quick fixes**: Create temporary solutions without permanent changes

## üöÄ Alfred Workflow

For even easier automation creation, we've included an Alfred workflow that integrates seamlessly with Automate with Gemini AI. Simply type your automation request in Alfred and it will be processed automatically.

The Alfred workflow provides:
- **Quick Access**: Create automations directly from Alfred's search bar
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with your existing Automate with Gemini AI setup
- **Instant Results**: Get feedback on automation creation status
